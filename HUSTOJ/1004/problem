Description
    Maybe there are 750,000 words in English and some words are prefix of other words, for example: the word "acm" can be treat as one prefix of "acmicpc". What's more, most of such pairs of words have relationship between them. Now give you a dictionary, your work is to tell me how many such pairs. There may be other characters in the word, for example '_','-',and so on. Pay attention that 'A' and 'a' are not the same character! 
Input
    In the first line of the input file there is an Integer T, which means the number of test cases. Followed by T test cases. For each test case, in the first line there is an integer N(0<N<50000), followed N lines, each contains a word whose length is less than 30 and no space appears in any word. There are no same words in two different lines. 
Output
    For each test case, tell me how many such pairs. If the number is larger than 11519, just divide it by 11519 and only output the remainder.
